# Change Log

## Version 1.0.0
* Release date: June 28, 2018
* Release status: GA

## What's new in 1.0.0
* Added a new experimental setting "mssql.persistQueryResultTabs" which when set to true will save your scroll position and active selection when switching between query result tabs
  * Note that this option is false by default because it [may cause high memory usage](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/webview#_retaincontextwhenhidden).
